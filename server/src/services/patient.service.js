//the patientData is an object containing the patient's information such as fullname, email, dateOfBirth, phone, address, gender, bloodGroup, emergencyContact, emergencyContactPhone, and emergencyContactRelationship.
//we check to see if our patient already exists in the database by searching for a patient with the same email address.
//the userId is the unique identifier for the user associated with the patient record. - it is used to link the patient information to the specific user in the database. - we use it when creating the patient record to ensure it is associated with the correct user.
//userId will also be used to update the user information after the patient record is created. and populate the user fields with the patient information.
