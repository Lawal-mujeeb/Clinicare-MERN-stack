const User = mongoose.models.User || model("User", userSchema); //this checks if amodel named User already exists to prevent subsequent checks. if it does not exist then it creates it. it is useful when compiling your schema as you make changes
export default User;
//model simply means what holds our user

// A model is a Mongoose object that gives you access to the database collection with methods like:
// User.create() — add a new user
// User.find() — get users
// User.findOne() — get one user
// User.updateOne() — update a user
// User.deleteOne() — delete a user

//  What makes mongoose.models.User already exist?
// It's because the User model has already been created earlier — likely from another file or a previous run (especially during development when the app reloads often).
//  Why is that a problem?
// Mongoose does not allow creating the same model twice.If you try to, it gives an error.

// ✅ So what does this line do?
// const User = mongoose.models.User || model("User", userSchema);
// It says:
// “If the User model already exists, use it.
// If not, create a new one.”

//  Why is this useful?
// It prevents Mongoose errors during development when your code reloads or runs more than once.

// Typical Workflow
// A user uploads a profile image.
// You send the image to Cloudinary.
// Cloudinary responds with:
// A secure_url (avatar) — this is what you display.
// A public_id (avatarId) — this is what you save to track/delete/update the image.
// You save both in the userSchema.
